                        A couple days ago, I released a mod for Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX on PC that makes it 
                        much more playable on modern systems (featuring a renderer replacement and a bunch 
                        of bug fixes). It's a sister project to my last project, PARTYMOD for THPS2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I did a writeup for my previous mod and I really liked doing that, so here's another:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX was Activision's first attempt at cashing in on their previous 
                        success with the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, adapting the format to other action 
                        sports. It was developed by Runecraft (as far as I can tell...) with an unknown 
                        amount of support on the Playstation release being provided by Shaba Games 
                        (previously known as a developer of action sports games in their own right), and 
                        was developed on Neversoft's engine used for the original THPS (though the game has 
                        many features from THPS2, so presumably some code was shared during that game's 
                        development). Unlike the THPS series, the Dreamcast port was done in-house by 
                        Runecraft (this will be important later on) and the PC port was done by the same 
                        team as THPS2, Grey Matter LTI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can't get the best read on how this game was developed. The PS1 demo lists only 
                        Runecraft as a developer (and the game's text is clearly British, with the use of 
                        "portaloo" and saying the Granny secret rider is "going in for tea" after unlocking 
                        her), and Shaba Games was also credited for the full release. The game had a 
                        considerable delay, with the original demo giving a Fall 2000 release date, but the 
                        game ultimately releasing in May 2001 (the game also has a trailer for the Activision 
                        O2 sublabel and advertises Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2! The game advertises its own 
                        sequel!!). The interesting thing is that the art noticeably differs between Dreamcast 
                        and PS1:

                        The final FMV for completing the career as Granny (featuring a... less than skilled 
                        rider dressed as an old woman) also is filmed in an LA area park, away from both 
                        development teams. Her look also differs drastically between PS1 and Dreamcast and the 
                        FMV reflects the PS1 look. Either way, I have trouble figuring out what exactly 
                        happened to make the game notably different between its two major releases.

                        Anyway, let's get to the PC port: the PC port was released last, with the Dreamcast 
                        version releasing in September of 2001 (the day after 9/11, and 6 months after the 
                        Dreamcast's discontinuation, so you'd be forgiven for not noticing...) and the PC 
                        version coming out in October. The PC port is based off of the PS1 release, but uses 
                        some assets from the Dreamcast release. Most notably, it uses the Dreamcast versions 
                        of all the levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Honestly I was kind of dreading working on this release, because the PC release is 
                        written in a very strange way. The main executable only initializes some settings, 
                        sets up the window and direct3d, then loads one of three DLLs and calls three 
                        functions within it before loading another. Each DLL represents a portion of the 
                        game: frontend.dll handles the menus, source.dll handles the gameplay, and editor.dll 
                        handles the park editor (ported over from THPS2, including many THPS2 menu assets). 
                        Each module reinitializes directinput and directsound for some reason. Ultimately I 
                        approached this by hooking the DLL loader and patching each DLL as they're loaded. 
                        I was thinking of rewriting the executable entirely, but I was concerned about 
                        compatibility with speedrun autosplitters (and I was also lazy).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I'd already patched THPS2 which runs on the same engine, I figured this game would 
                        be easy to patch as well. While there were some differences in the renderer, it was 
                        pretty straightforward to get my first frames. The interesting thing was the lack of 
                        environment I was seeing.

                    <p>
                        Here I learned that the game was trying to load textures in a format my code didn't 
                        recognize. THPS2 only use paletted 4 and 8 bit color textures, MHPB added support for 
                        16-bit color in 3 formats: RGB 5:6:5, RGBA 5:5:5:1, and RGBA 4:4:4:4. This was my 
                        first hint that these were actually the real Dreamcast levels, not just the PS1 levels 
                        with some Dreamcast retrofits, as Grey Matter had done with THPS2! Those formats were 
                        straightforward to implement, and now I had mostly gotten things working. All that 
                        remained was redoing some of the sprite code for UI elements, porting over my code 
                        to get Bink FMVs working, and fixing some depth issues.

                        None of the polish work on the renderer was particularly interesting, but it gave me 
                        some interesting insight. The game was having some trouble handling certain depth 
                        sorting situations (especially with transparency). I figure the game was taking some 
                        advantage of the Dreamcast's built in depth peeling, so it could be more relaxed about 
                        rendering order. Additionally, that version has rare support for the Dreamcast's 
                        bumpmapping!

                        Another alpha blending issue that I was interested in is that certain textures were 
                        drawing with strange colors compared to the Dreamcast release. I think what happened 
                        here is that the Dreamcast renderer doesn't support some blending modes that the PS1 
                        renderer did (if they used Treyarch's ports of THPS as a base, this is almost 
                        definitely what happened. Similar issues exist in those as well). This results in 
                        branding appearing in the wrong colors, which I thought would be a much more urgent 
                        issue:

                                Note how on Playstation, the logo is "burned in", using a subtractive blending mode. 
                                That was retained for Dreamcast, but it didn't correctly support the effect, making 
                                it look like a sticker. Also note the incorrect transparency on PC.

                    <p>
                        Ultimately I opted to keep those as-is, because they would also affect certain 
                        elements that relied upon the correct blending behavior that were brought over from 
                        the PS1 release. Someday I would like to see what the PS1 levels would look like 
                        loaded into this version of the engine. I figure it would look a whole lot nicer that 
                        way. I'd gotten it looking reasonably like the Dreamcast version (I even fixed some 
                        texture transparency bugs from the PC release!), with some settings to get it closer 
                        to the PS1 look if people would like, which I think is a good compromise for now.

                        With the renderer done, I moved onto input. I thought this would be the same as the 
                        renderer, just porting the THPS2 code into MHPB, but I was wrong! The input handler 
                        is entirely new. Previously they were emulating a PS1 controller, but for this they 
                        rewrote it entirely and use what is kind of a strange system. They provide a few 
                        mechanisms, one to get the current controller state like how things used to work, 
                        and another where a 32-bit mask is given which represents action-based controls. 
                        I ended up putting the new mechanisms on top of my old playstation controller 
                        emulation written for THPS2 because I'm lazy. It was straightforward to write and 
                        frankly not that interesting. Rumble support was taken out for this game, which is 
                        a slight bummer.

                        The last interesting note is the game's mouse handling. Both THPS2 and MHPB use the 
                        absolute position of the mouse, but THPS2 uses window space positioning and MHPB uses 
                        some translation between screen and window space that doesn't work at all. On some modern 
                        systems, the pointer will jump somewhere around 64 pixels at a time, making most 
                        controls unreachable in its original form. I was able to adapt my THPS2 mouse code 
                        easily, making those controls usable for the first time in a while.

                        Honestly, that's kind of the theme of this port. Things that worked in THPS2 were 
                        often broken. I can only imagine that this port was really rushed to just get the 
                        game out of the door and recoup some costs. Some rendering features were broken to a 
                        potentially harmful degree (glass shards would sometimes take over the screen and 
                        start strobing. This was handled correctly in THPS2 but for some reason regressed for 
                        MHPB). I'm happy to hopefully get this game into a playable state for anyone wanting 
                        to check out the PC version. This game is often forgotten about despite being one of 
                        the better action sports games of the time. I want to do some more work to restore 
                        some of the PS1 look, but as it is, it's a good version to play with its fast load 
                        times.
