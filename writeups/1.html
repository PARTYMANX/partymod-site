                        For the past couple of months, I've been developing something I'd been scheming 
                        about for what looks to be half a year or so, judging by file and commit dates: 
                        a modernization patch for THPS2, featuring a new renderer (now using Vulkan 
                        instead of D3D7!), among other changes.

                        THPS2 was ported to PC by LTI Gray Matter, a studio that specialized in porting 
                        games to PC, including a few games based on Neversoft's old 'M3D' (there's no 
                        real formal name, but that's what I'll call it. more on that later) engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, to start the whole process of patching the game, I looked around to see 
                        what kind of help I could find for reverse engineering. The first resource I 
                        found was actually the very first demo of the game, Psy-Q debug symbols managed 
                        to leak with a German (iirc) release of the demo. This release looked to be 
                        really dated, with its structure matching closer to THPS1, so I looked around 
                        a bit more, ultimately discovering that the iOS release of the game also had 
                        debugging symbols, and luckily that was also based off the PC release! 
                        Additionally I've since learned that apparently the Mac release also didn't 
                        have symbols stripped out. Having symbols available was a huge help for 
                        navigating the reverse engineering for the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something I found interesting in the credits is that someone is credited for 
                        "GTE emulation". That's kind of a theme for this port: all of the 
                        matrix math on the PS1 would've been done through its GTE chip, so they recreated 
                        that for PC. Past that, they also handle controllers by recreating PS1 controller 
                        button structures (this would also be the approach taken for the later PS2 games, 
                        those recreate full dualshock 2 packets!), even the mouse support ends up 
                        pressing fake buttons (aside from menu selection, which i found odd)! 
                        Most importantly, all of the graphics are a sort of emulation of the PS1 GPU:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The renderer is built essentially in two halves: there's one half that performs 
                        all transformations, clipping, and ordering (using the original "M3D" functions 
                        from Neversoft, presumably the M is for Mick West, programmer and co-founder of 
                        Neversoft (now a big-time Skeptic! weird!)), then there's the other half which 
                        finally gets those rasterized. The first half talks to the second half through 
                        slightly modified PS1 gpu commands (and a sizeable new rendering system involving 
                        a special command that we'll get to). All UI and some effects like sparks, dust, 
                        and shattered objects are done through original PS1 gpu commands, with a single 
                        floating point depth value tacked on to make them work in the depth buffer.

                        The most important command is <code>0xB0</code>. On the PS1 it was a blit to VRAM
                        (iirc), but in THPS2 PC, it's <code>renderDXPOLY()</code>, this is an extra GPU 
                        command that handles all of the actual 3D rasterization in the game. While 
                        the previous commands have vertices specified in integer, this command uses 
                        floating point, basically ready to go directly into direct3d after fog and gamma
                        correction are applied to vertex colors. It also allows for a flexible number of 
                        vertices, though it only ever renders triangles and quads. Despite having a depth 
                        buffer now, all polygons are pre-sorted by depth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When translating these commands to Vulkan, I decided on a bindless style 
                        structure. All draws get put into a single vertex buffer including position, 
                        UVs, vertex color, and texture for each vertex. Textures are all placed into a 
                        single array, so that the fragment shader can sample from any texture, depending 
                        on vertex data. This allowed me to batch polygon draws even if they had 
                        different textures. That is, until i discovered that this causes rendering 
                        issues on AMD. Oh well!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the new renderer has a depth buffer, Gray Matter needed to do some 
                        tricks to get coplanar polygons to display in the correct order: it's not 
                        particularly special, but they added a couple depth bias factors, some of which 
                        can misbehave and make certain objects appear in the wrong order. Fun!

                        These sorts of hacks were the name of the game for Gray Matter, who also applied 
                        Treyarch's high-resolution textures from the Dreamcast release of THPS2 to the 
                        game. These textures aren't baked into each asset file like the PS1 textures, 
                        instead the game intercepts textures when loading them into VRAM and replaces 
                        them from external BMP files named after the 32-bit CRC of the texture's 
                        original file name (Neversoft was a big fan of CRC for hashing, here's Mick West 
                        talking about it: 
                        <a href="https://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/04/practical-hash-ids/">
                            https://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/04/practical-hash-ids/
                        </a>). If the function that replaces the texture data is disabled, the game will 
                        just fall back to the PS1 textures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These textures weren't really designed for the original texture blending 
                        algorithm of the PS1 (which multiplies the texture by the vertex color times 
                        two), so Gray Matter chose to lighten every surface through a gamma lookup table, 
                        which also results in the game looking washed out when compared to the PS1 
                        riginal. This wasn't quite enough for some parts of levels (the skies in Venice 
                        Beach and School II, specifically), so Gray Matter also placed some direct 
                        modifications to the vertex colors in these levels into the rendering pipeline. 
                        With the original texture blending algorithm implemented and with original textures, 
                        removing these hacks restored most of the PS1 look of the game.

                        An issue with the game is that many UI assets were made assuming that the game 
                        would be rendering at a 4:3 512x240, making certain things like the game's HUD 
                        to be sampled at weird offsets. Now that we had shaders at our disposal, I 
                        applied a strategic bilinear sampler so that we could get a sharp 4:3 512x240 
                        without shimmering artifacts from normal nearest neighbor sampling.

                        Speaking of resolutions, the game has a really interesting inherited trait from 
                        PS1: the way that viewports work emulates PS1 exactly. Viewports are always 
                        expressed on a 512x512 grid that assumes a 512x240 frame. The viewport shifts 
                        by 256 pixels every frame, recreating the double buffering effect they would've 
                        used on the PS1 framebuffer.

                        With the renderer taken care of, I wanted to see if I could fix the crashes the 
                        game would regularly run into. Often when loading into the Bullring, the final 
                        level, the game would crash. The game leaves behind a log where you can find 
                        that the game fails to process some things in the level's trig file (this file 
                        is a script that defines what to load into the level). Once I even got it to 
                        load, but with absolutely nothing in the level:

                        figured out why this happens: the memory manager is extremely susceptible to 
                        memory corruption if out of bounds writes occur.

                        the first byte is its length, and the second is its parent. The parent goes 
                        unused when the block is allocated, so memory actually overwrites that portion 
                        of the header. It's easy to see how data gets corrupt: when an out-of-bounds 
                        write occurs, it's overwriting the next block's header, changing its size. When 
                        trying to find where this corruption was occurring, I accidentally made 
                        allocations four bytes too large, which happened to fix the corruption problem 
                        entirely. How convenient!

                        There were a couple more common crashes: one would occur when the memory manager 
                        ran out of memory. When this happens, the game will enter a while(true) loop. 
                        Because the original game would suppress Alt-F4, windows key, and appear in 
                        front of almost applications, this made the game near-impossible to exit when 
                        it ran out of memory. because of the memory corruption, this would happen pretty 
                        regularly if you would speedrun the game. There was one last, unknown crash 
                        where D3D would run into an error after playing the final fmv upon completing 
                        the game. No idea what caused that, but the renderer rewrite fixed it anyway.

                        Writing this patch was very fun and is the project that I'm most proud of so 
                        far. I'm really happy to have managed to release a Vulkan 1.3 renderer with 
                        relatively few problems (other than some AMD crashes cropping up here and there). 
                        I hope to get more people into speedrunning this game as it's been one of my 
                        favorites in the series, it just feels great to play. anyway that's it go check 
                        it out
